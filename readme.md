# Solutions for The Robotics Advances Course Technical Evaluation

This documentation provides a comprehensive solution for the technical evaluation in the Robotics Advanced Course. The problem was successfully tackled using Python programming. The details of each solution are outlined below:

## Atod Clusters

### Inputs
- N = number of stars in the sky
- M = number of magical connections drawn
- Ai = star number Invoker identified
- Bi = star number Puck pointed out

### Outputs
- K = total number of Atod Clusters formed
- Subsequent K rows = list the number of connections each Atod Cluster has

### Assumptions
1. The stars are numbered from 1 to N, this inicates that 1 is always the first number.
2. The arrays are always organized.

### Initial values
- ***n*** = 1
- ***count*** = 0
- ***row*** = 0
- ***delete_list*** = [0] * N
- ***results_list*** = [ ]

## Miranda And Arrows
### Inputs
- N = number of arrows
- K = maximum acumulative distance the arrows can fly.
- Distances = star number Invoker identified

### Outputs
- Maximum number of arrows Mirana can release to avoid
peril.

### Assumptions
1. Miranda can only throw the arrow next in the list

### Initial values
- ***n*** = 0
- ***current_max*** = 0
